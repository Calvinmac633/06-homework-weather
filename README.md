Welcome to my Weather App!

This is a fully functional, user input based, weather search engine. 
Simply enter the name of a city and click on the search button to the right. 

A list of the most recent cities you searched will be available on the left hand side of the page.
To avoid typing the city you just searched again, you can click on the city's button below the search bar to populate the weather display as you did before. 

The app uses two different APIs to gather all of the information presented.
Therefore, the user's computer must have an internet connection in order to work properly.
